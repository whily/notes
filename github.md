Notes for Github/git.

### Markdown

#### HTML code

* To show pipe '|' character in a table (where '|' serves as column
  separation), use HTML code: &amp;#124;

* Similarly, to literally show () after [], HTML code &amp;#40; can be
  used for the left parenthesis '(' (of course other special symbols
  can be substituted in this case).
